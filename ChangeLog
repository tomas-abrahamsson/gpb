Version 3.7
2013-dec-13

	* Add a (GNU) Makefile, for projects that prefer to build this
	way. Thanks to Graham Crowe for suggestions and ideas.
	* Rework/fix the substitution in gpb_version.hrl.
	* Add support for Erlang/OTP R16B03, by working around a
	bug in syntax_tools (reversion of local implicit funs).
	* Change the months in this file, from numeric to 3-letters, to
	avoid ambiguities with different ways of writing dates in various
	parts of the world.

Version 3.6
2013-nov-13

	* Add nif support for the strings_as_binaries (-strbin) option,
	thanks to Louis-Philippe Gauthier for reporting this.
	* Add an is_binary guard to the top-level generated decode_msg/2
	function. Thanks to Klas Johansson for suggesting this.

Version 3.5
2013-oct-27

	* Licence change: from LGPL 2 to LGPL 2.1

Version 3.4
2013-oct-27

	* Licence modification/clarification: clarify that the licence (in
	the file COPYING.LIB) does not cover code generated with gpb.

Version 3.3
2013-oct-27

	* Fix several errors in the gpb.app.src so that it works with
	Elixir and Relex, thanks to Paulo Almeida.
	* When decoding, reject messages with invalid varints.
	Invaid varints are encoded with too many bits. Previously,
	decoding a varint with very many bits (ie: with very many leading
	bytes > 128) would cause the Erlang VM to construct a very large
	number when decoding the varint. This would cause the Erlang VM to
	use excessive cpu resources and could eventually cause the Erlang
	VM to run out of memory. Now parsing fails immediately reading too
	many varint bits.
	* Fix a bug when generating code for maps.
	* Teach the benchmarks to do maps, and also improve
	various other benchmark related things.

Version 3.2
2013-sep-16

	* Add preliminary support for maps, for generating code that
	encodes from and decodes to maps, as well as merges and verifies
	maps. The maps support is experimental.
	* Bugfix verification of integers: the wrong error reason could be
	generated for integers out of range.
	* Bugfix various dialyzer issues.

Version 3.1
2013-sep-05

	* Bugfix compilation of several files (only the first file
	was actually compiled, even if several files were specified)
	* Add possibility to generate and encode a descriptor, which is a
	self-describing byte-blob according to descriptor.proto.
	* Add possibility to make the generated code compile-time
	independent of gpb by generating the introspection information to
	proplists instead of to #field{} records. The latter required
	including gpb.hrl at compiletime. (There's no run-time dependency)
	* Add possibility to prefix message/record and names and module
	names to avoid name collisions.
	* Add -type to the commad line options, thanks to Louis-Philippe
	Gauthier. Previously it existed only as an Erlang API option.

Version 3.0
2013-aug-24
	* Improve decoding performance by roughly 8--19%
	* Completely rewrite the code generator. Use a parse-transform
	  instead of formatting and assembling strings.
	* Minor improvement in the generated code for version_as_list.

Version 2.3
2013-aug-18
	* Fix Rebar compile on non-GNU systems, such as Mac OS X, thanks
	to Everton Ribeiro
	* Bugfix (mostly) rare compilation breakage: depending on the
	date/time of generation, a new-line was inserted, causing a
	compilation error.
	* Ignore non-version-like tags

Version 2.2
2013-jul-13

	* Wrap generated skip-functions with quotes. Thanks to jesse-ad.
	* Experimental support for calling protoc code via a NIF
	* Empty lists are now default values for repeated fields. Thanks
	to Martin Donath.
	* New option, use_packages for prepending the package name found
	in the proto file, to the message names. Thanks to Martin Donath.
	* New option: strings_as_binaries (-strbin), for returning strings
	as binaries. Thanks to Lars Thorsen for suggesting this option.
	* New option: {o_erl,Dir} (-o-erl Dir), {o_hrl,Dir} (-o-hrl Dir)
	and {o_nif_cc,Dir} (-o-nif-cc Dir) to specify destination
	directory by file type. Thanks to Patrik Sandahl for suggesting
	those options.
	* New option: include_as_lib (-il) to include gpb.hrl as a
	library. This makes it easier to integrate with rebar. Thanks to
	Martin Donath.
	* Generate introspection functions for enum conversions:
	M:enum_symbol_by_value/2, M:enum_value_by_symbol/2,
	M:enum_symbol_by_value_<Enum>/1, M:enum_value_by_symbol_<Enum>/1;
	thanks to Patrik Sandahl for suggesting those functions.
	* Bugfix name resolution. Thanks to Heiner Bunjes for reporting
	the bug. This prompted a major rewrite of the name resolution code
	that was originally a quick patch-work, and not in very good shape.
	* Handle C-style comments. Thanks to Patrik Sandahl for reporting
	this bug.
	* Add a section to the README.md showing rebar integration, thanks
	to Bin Wang for asking the question that prompted me to write it
	up.
	* Bugfix command line option parsing using the -extra alternative.
	* Benchmark code improvements.
	* Build: version number: defined format and enforced/verified
	consistency between gpb_version.hrl and src/gpb.app.src: using the
	git tag as the source of information.

Version 2.1
2011-oct-31  Tomas Abrahamsson  <tomas.abrahamsson@gmail.com>

	* Package names are dotted rather than with underscores
	* New generated introspection function: M:get_package_name/0.

Version 2.0
2011-jul-10  Tomas Abrahamsson  <tab@lysator.liu.se>

	* First public version
