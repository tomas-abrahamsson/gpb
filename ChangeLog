Version 3.21.3
2016-May-30

	* Add support for extending messages in other packages.  As part
	of this, also fixup resolution of what 'extend' refers to.
	Thanks to Steven Gravell for reporting and providing code
	outlining the way to go.
	* Fix a bug if a message is 'extend'ed more than once.

Version 3.21.2
2016-May-27

	* Make it easier to HiPE compile benchmarks. Thanks to Luke
	Bakken.
	* Fix dialyzer error in the generated code, in verifiers for
	repeated fields, with the -Wunmatched_returns flag to dialyzer.
	Thanks to Luke Bakken for reporting this.

Version 3.21.1
2016-May-25

	* Improve performance slightly for maps by replacing calls to
	maps:find with map matching expressions. On the benchmarks, it
	only yields a 2-7% speedup, but the generated code looks nicer.
	* Refine the type definitions in gpb.hrl
	* Make dialyzer happy about gpb. (It is also happy about generated
	code.)
	* Several benchmark updates:
	-- Make it easier to run benchmarks for code generated with -maps.
	-- Update the benchmarks/README.txt, thanks to Luke Bakken.
	-- Use pkg-config if present to get protobuf lib information,
	   thanks to Luke Bakken.
	-- Use which to find protoc command, else use PROTOC or PROTOHOME,
	   thanks to Luke Bakken.
	-- Pass CXXFLAGS to C++ compiler so that include path to erl_nif.h
	   can be specified, thanks to Luke Bakken.

Version 3.21.0
2016-May-17

	* Add support for map fields, ie fields of type
	map<KeyType,ValueType>. Only scalars (but not enums) and strings
	(not bytes) are allowed as keys. Any type, except maps, is
	allowed as value. Map fields are about to make it into Google
	protobuf 3.0.0, which as of this writing is still in beta. It
	appears it will be available in 3.0.0 for both proto2 and proto3
	syntaxes. (So far, gpb does not support proto3 at all.) Map fields
	have been tested with Google protobuf 3.0.0-beta2.
	The erlang-internal representation of a map<_,_> field is a list
	of 2-tuples---the order is undefined on decoding---or an Erlang map
	if the maps option is used.
	* Some option texts have been improved for the "protoc-erl --help"
	command.
	* With the maps option specified, the generated verifier now produces
	a more helpful error if any non-optional fields are missing from
	the map.
	* The descriptor proto has been updated (the -descr option).
	* The README has been updated.

Version 3.20.3
2016-May-04

	* Encode negative int32 values using 64 bits, for interop with
	other implementations. On decoding, assume either 32 or 64 bit
	encodings can appear. This is what Google's protobuf (C++) does.
	The same goes for negative enums. Thanks to YeJun Su for
	reporting.

Version 3.20.2
2016-Apr-08

	* Don't try to generate default values for maps. Thanks to
	Louis-Philippe Gauthier.
	* Accept the syntax="proto2"; statement, but so far only "proto2".
	Thanks to Louis-Philippe Gauthier for suggesting support of the
	syntax statement.

Version 3.20.1
2016-Mar-17

	* Bugfix the generated NIF code: if the .proto file specifies
	package, then any enums must be specified with namespace. Thanks
	to vesperusiak for reporting.

Version 3.20.0
2016-Mar-01

	* Add an option {erlc_compile_options,Str} (-erlc_compile_options Str)
	for inserting a -compile(Str) option into the generated code.
	Thanks to Guilherme Andrade.

Version 3.19.0
2016-Feb-04

	* Add an option msg_name_to_lower (Cmdline: -msgtolower) for
	changing all message name to lower case. Thanks to Roowe.

Version 3.18.10
2015-Nov-27

	* Fix bug with extend inside a message body. Thanks to Michael
	Ries.

Version 3.18.9
2015-Nov-17

	* Support extend inside a message body. Thanks to Michael Ries.

Version 3.18.8
2015-Jun-24

	* Fix another decoding/merging bug for maps with the option
	maps_unset_optional=omitted, this time for oneof with sub messages
	to be merged. This bug, too, was found with the quickcheck and
	gpb-eqc.

Version 3.18.7
2015-Jun-17

	* Fix typos in comments and texts. Thanks to Giacomo Olgeni for
	spotting and fixing many.

Version 3.18.6
2015-Jun-10

	* Implement support for maps in NIFs. As part of this, rework the
	eunit tests to run the NIFs in a separate erlang vm, for stability.

Version 3.18.5
2015-May-29

	* Fix a few decoding/merging bugs for maps with option
	maps_unset_optional set to omitted. The bugs were found with the
	help of quickcheck and the gpb-eqc.
	* The gpb_compile_descr module was forgotten in the gpb.app.src
	file, now it is included.

Version 3.18.4
2015-May-09

	* Include also the build in the hex.pm package. Thanks to Tilman
	Holschuh for finding it out.

Version 3.18.3
2015-May-08

	* Include the protoc-erl in the hex.pm package. Thanks to Tilman
	Holschuh for finding it out.

Version 3.18.2
2015-May-08

	* Bugfix the version tag in the hex.pm package. Thanks to Tilman
	Holschuh.
	* Bugfix decoding, for fields with optional submessages, for maps,
	generated with the option maps_unset_optional set to omitted.

Version 3.18.1
2015-Apr-29

	* Bugfix the helper/package-for-hex.pm about the file name change
	rebar.config -> rebar.config.script

Version 3.18.0
2015-Apr-29

	* Add an option, maps_unset_optional, for omitting optional
	values, for maps. With this option, there can now be an enumerator
	value that is 'undefined' without any confusion if it is
	optional. Thanks to Brett Bethke for prompting this to get
	implemented.
	* Test the generated code also for maps. This is ifdef-protected,
	so it still works with older Erlang versions, but maps are not
	tested then, of course. Due to this, the rebar.config has now
	turned into rebar.config.script.
	* Update the benchmarks to newer software versions and newer
	hardware.

Version 3.17.13
2015-Apr-16

	* Bugfix verification of strings with the strings_as_binary
	(-strbin) option. Thanks to Tilman Holschuh for fixing and to Luis
	Rascão for adding a test for it.

Version 3.17.12
2015-Mar-08

	* Bugfix exported types for CamelCase message names. Thanks to
	Louis-Philippe Gauthier for fixing and to Luis Rascão for adding a
	test for it.

Version 3.17.11
2015-Feb-23

	* When generating typespecs, generate types for messages, and
	export those types. Thanks to Luis Rascão.

Version 3.17.10
2015-Feb-17

	* Fix Issues Building on Windows/Cygwin. Thanks to Brett Bethke.

Version 3.17.9
2015-Jan-30

	* When generating typespecs, generate types for enums, and export
	those types. Thanks to Luis Rascão.

Version 3.17.8
2015-Jan-25

	* Add support for the enum "option allow_alias = true;" which
	allows more than one enum to have the same numerical value. Gpb
	will decode to the first defined enum symbol. Gpb no longer
	supports allow_alias = false. This option appeared in Google
	Protobuf version 2.5.0. Thanks to bb4242 for reporting.

Version 3.17.7
2015-Jan-07

	* Bugfix type specs for strings when using the strings_as_binaries
	option. Thanks to Luis Rascão.

Version 3.17.6
2014-Dec-30

	* Bugfix NIF linking in eunit tests on Mac. Thanks to Luis
	Rascão.

Version 3.17.5
2014-Dec-15

	* Bugfix generated NIF code for with the -strbin option: the
	utf8_to_uint32 function was unused, as was (mostly) the
	utf8_count_codepoints. Thanks to Louis-Philippe Gauthier for
	reporting.

Version 3.17.4
2014-Dec-12

	* Bugfix generated NIF code for enums defined within
	messages. Thanks to Louis-Philippe Gauthier for reporting and
	providing an initial solution.
	* Bugfix generated NIF code for strings with the -strbin (or
	strings_as_binaries) option. Thanks to Louis-Philippe Gauthier for
	reporting and providing a solution.


Version 3.17.3
2014-Dec-02

	* Bugfix parsing of files that specify a package, and import other
	files that also specify a(nother) package. Thanks to Wang Chao for
	asking the question prompting me to fix this.
	* Add a -pkgs command line option, for use_packages.

Version 3.17.2
2014-Nov-13

	* Rework the option parsing. No functional changes.
	* in helpers/git-hooks/pre-push, allow push of non-tagged
	non-master branches to github.

Version 3.17.1
2014-Oct-29

	* Bugfix decoding oneof when for sub messages, in the data-driven
	decoder in gpb. When the same oneof sub message appeared twice,
	the oneof field was overwritten instead of merged. This did not
	affect generated code. It only affected the gpb:decode_msg/3.

Version 3.17.0
2014-Oct-26

	* Support oneof fields. It appeared in protobuf 2.6.0, and is
	essentially several optional fields sharing the same record
	position (memory in the C++ alternative).
	* Make the name of the two records for fields and rpcs
	configurable. They ought to have been prefixed with gpb_ long ago,
	but that was not done. At least now, it is possible to redefine
	the record names, in case of clashes.
	* Handle services in descriptors.
	* Bugfix compilation for descriptors.
        * Add an option `warnings_as_errors' along with command line
	options -Werror, -Wall, -W1, -W0 and -W, that mimimcs the options
	to erlc. This also adds a new return value for failures: error.

Version 3.16.0
2014-Oct-13

	* When generating NIF code, also do the encoding in the
	NIF. Previously, the encoding was still done using plain Erlang,
	only decoding was in the NIF. Now the NIF does both encoding and
	decoding.
	* Fix potential memory leak when decoding, for odd/unusual error
	cases.

Version 3.15.0
2014-Oct-13

	* Specify that the NIF should run in a cpu-bound dirty scheduler
	when supported. This currently requires Erlang 17.3 built with
	--enable-dirty-schedulers. Thanks to Louis-Philippe Gauthier for
	asking the question, prompting me get it done.

Version 3.14.0
2014-Oct-01

	* In the Makefile, allow ERL and ERLC to be overridden via
	environment variables, thanks to Graham Crowe.
	* Avoid, and attempt to handle, unicode output in compilation
	errors in eunit tests.

Version 3.13.0
2014-Sep-17

	* New way to invoke the compiler: bin/protoc-erl. Thanks to Luis
	Rascão for the implementation.

Version 3.12.2
2014-Sep-16

	* Fix a race condition in the Makefile between all and doc
	* Elide falsely failing nif tests with 17 on 32 bits with an
	erlang vm compiled with gcc 4.9.0 or newer.

Version 3.12.1
2014-Aug-12

	* Update the README, with info on meta data for services. Thanks
	to Luis Rascão.

Version 3.12.0
2014-Aug-12

	* Add support for retrieving meta data for services. Rename
	gpb_compile:msg_defs/2,3 into gpb_compile:proto_defs/2,3, but
	retain the old function name and option names for backwards
	compatibility. Thanks to Luis Rascão for the implementation.

Version 3.11.0
2014-Jul-20

	* Add helpers for packaging to hex.pm. Thanks to Dylan Lukes and
	Paul Schoenfelder for prompting this.
	* Version numbers revisited, the version on github is now intended
	to always be reltools compliant, ie: to always consist of only
	integers and dots. Thanks to Volodymyr Kyrychenko
	for taking the initiative to this.

Version 3.10
2014-Jun-26

	* Bugfix verification of optional sub message fields, thanks to
	Klas Johansson.
	* Fix compilation warnings with Erlang/OTP 17.0
	* Improve/bugfix eunit tests in gpb_codegen_tests and
	gpb_compile_tests (compilation warning and nif include path issue,
	respectively)

Version 3.9
2014-Feb-04

	* Avoid single field map access---ie expressions on the form
	X#{key}---since neither the maps pre-release, nor the rc1 of R17
	supports it. Use matching to access such fields instead. This
	applies to records as well as maps. Performance is unaltered.

Version 3.8
2014-Feb-01

	* Bugfix generated code when there are no messages defined.
	Thanks to Graham Crowe for reporting.
	* Add possibility to suffix message/record and names and module
	names.

Version 3.7.1
2013-Dec-14

	* Bugfix a race condition in the Makefile. Thanks to Graham Crowe
	for fruitful discussions.
	* Rework the workaround for the bug in the syntax_tools in R16B03,
	so that the code that uses the parse transform need not change.
	Handle the odd case entirely in the parse transform.

Version 3.7
2013-Dec-13

	* Add a (GNU) Makefile, for projects that prefer to build this
	way. Thanks to Graham Crowe for suggestions and ideas.
	* Rework/fix the substitution in gpb_version.hrl.
	* Add support for Erlang/OTP R16B03, by working around a
	bug in syntax_tools (reversion of local implicit funs).
	* Change the months in this file, from numeric to 3-letters, to
	avoid ambiguities with different ways of writing dates in various
	parts of the world.

Version 3.6
2013-Nov-13

	* Add nif support for the strings_as_binaries (-strbin) option,
	thanks to Louis-Philippe Gauthier for reporting this.
	* Add an is_binary guard to the top-level generated decode_msg/2
	function. Thanks to Klas Johansson for suggesting this.

Version 3.5
2013-Oct-27

	* Licence change: from LGPL 2 to LGPL 2.1

Version 3.4
2013-Oct-27

	* Licence modification/clarification: clarify that the licence (in
	the file COPYING.LIB) does not cover code generated with gpb.

Version 3.3
2013-Oct-27

	* Fix several errors in the gpb.app.src so that it works with
	Elixir and Relex, thanks to Paulo Almeida.
	* When decoding, reject messages with invalid varints.
	Invaid varints are encoded with too many bits. Previously,
	decoding a varint with very many bits (ie: with very many leading
	bytes > 128) would cause the Erlang VM to construct a very large
	number when decoding the varint. This would cause the Erlang VM to
	use excessive cpu resources and could eventually cause the Erlang
	VM to run out of memory. Now parsing fails immediately reading too
	many varint bits.
	* Fix a bug when generating code for maps.
	* Teach the benchmarks to do maps, and also improve
	various other benchmark related things.

Version 3.2
2013-Sep-16

	* Add preliminary support for maps, for generating code that
	encodes from and decodes to maps, as well as merges and verifies
	maps. The maps support is experimental.
	* Bugfix verification of integers: the wrong error reason could be
	generated for integers out of range.
	* Bugfix various dialyzer issues.

Version 3.1
2013-Sep-05

	* Bugfix compilation of several files (only the first file
	was actually compiled, even if several files were specified)
	* Add possibility to generate and encode a descriptor, which is a
	self-describing byte-blob according to descriptor.proto.
	* Add possibility to make the generated code compile-time
	independent of gpb by generating the introspection information to
	proplists instead of to #field{} records. The latter required
	including gpb.hrl at compiletime. (There's no run-time dependency)
	* Add possibility to prefix message/record and names and module
	names to avoid name collisions.
	* Add -type to the command line options, thanks to Louis-Philippe
	Gauthier. Previously it existed only as an Erlang API option.

Version 3.0
2013-Aug-24
	* Improve decoding performance by roughly 8--19%
	* Completely rewrite the code generator. Use a parse-transform
	  instead of formatting and assembling strings.
	* Minor improvement in the generated code for version_as_list.

Version 2.3
2013-Aug-18
	* Fix Rebar compile on non-GNU systems, such as Mac OS X, thanks
	to Everton Ribeiro.
	* Bugfix (mostly) rare compilation breakage: depending on the
	date/time of generation, a new-line was inserted, causing a
	compilation error.
	* Ignore non-version-like tags

Version 2.2
2013-Jul-13

	* Wrap generated skip-functions with quotes. Thanks to jesse-ad.
	* Experimental support for calling protoc code via a NIF
	* Empty lists are now default values for repeated fields. Thanks
	to Martin Donath.
	* New option, use_packages for prepending the package name found
	in the proto file, to the message names. Thanks to Martin Donath.
	* New option: strings_as_binaries (-strbin), for returning strings
	as binaries. Thanks to Lars Thorsen for suggesting this option.
	* New option: {o_erl,Dir} (-o-erl Dir), {o_hrl,Dir} (-o-hrl Dir)
	and {o_nif_cc,Dir} (-o-nif-cc Dir) to specify destination
	directory by file type. Thanks to Patrik Sandahl for suggesting
	those options.
	* New option: include_as_lib (-il) to include gpb.hrl as a
	library. This makes it easier to integrate with rebar. Thanks to
	Martin Donath.
	* Generate introspection functions for enum conversions:
	M:enum_symbol_by_value/2, M:enum_value_by_symbol/2,
	M:enum_symbol_by_value_<Enum>/1, M:enum_value_by_symbol_<Enum>/1;
	thanks to Patrik Sandahl for suggesting those functions.
	* Bugfix name resolution. Thanks to Heiner Bunjes for reporting
	the bug. This prompted a major rewrite of the name resolution code
	that was originally a quick patch-work, and not in very good shape.
	* Handle C-style comments. Thanks to Patrik Sandahl for reporting
	this bug.
	* Add a section to the README.md showing rebar integration, thanks
	to Bin Wang for asking the question that prompted me to write it
	up.
	* Bugfix command line option parsing using the -extra alternative.
	* Benchmark code improvements.
	* Build: version number: defined format and enforced/verified
	consistency between gpb_version.hrl and src/gpb.app.src: using the
	git tag as the source of information.

Version 2.1
2011-Oct-31  Tomas Abrahamsson  <tomas.abrahamsson@gmail.com>

	* Package names are dotted rather than with underscores
	* New generated introspection function: M:get_package_name/0.

Version 2.0
2011-Jul-10  Tomas Abrahamsson  <tab@lysator.liu.se>

	* First public version
